## Analysing the Ratings of Consumers
For this project, I received two datasets such as BA reviews.csv and countries.csv. 

The goal of the project was to come up with an interactive dashboard in Tableau to show different airline ratings across various metrics and provide some insights to the business leaders on what can be improved upon.


#### Here are a few insights that I can share with the stakeholders:

All ratings declined between late 2020 and 2021, which we can surmise is due to the COVID-19 pandemic when flights were cancelled and/or delayed and new restrictions came into place, reducing customer satisfaction.

Entertainment, food and beverages, and value for money are consistently low across countries and aircrafts, which means that the airline would benefit from upgrading or revamping these aspects of their airline experience. 

The overall rating for the airline is quite high (4.2) over the 7-year time period, which suggests that the airline is doing quite well when it comes to customer satisfaction, overall.
